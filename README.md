* Identify suspicious IP addresses.
* Analyze TCP communication using Follow TCP Stream.
* Investigate HTTP plain-text credentials.
* Understand brute-force attacks.
* Analyze VoIP traffic and call replay.
* Practice Wireshark display filters.
* Develop practical SOC investigation skills.

## 🛡️ Purpose of the Project

This project aims to develop practical knowledge of network security monitoring and investigation.

The skills practiced in these labs are relevant to:

* Network Traffic Monitoring
* Packet Analysis
* IP Address Investigation
* TCP Stream Analysis
* HTTP Security Analysis
* Credential Exposure Investigation
* Brute-Force Detection
